Create a simple React application that manages contacts. The application should be able to: 
- list all contacts 
- add a contact 
- edit a contact 
- delete a contact 
Contacts have a First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Address, Email 
Users should be able to sort or filter the list of contacts based on any field. 
For the sake of simplicity, the contact list does not need to persist between application reloads.

Apart from React which is required, you may use any tech stack you like. Please explain your choice of tools/frameworks/libraries in the README file of your project. 
Feel free to take as much or as little time as you see fit for this assignment. It would be nice if you could provide us with a rough development timeline, though. 
Once you are finished, please zip your solution and email it back to us
